# ComPyType

Implementation of our "Type-level Computations for Ruby Libraries" in Python. Python programmers regularly use dataframes, matrices etc. and type-level computation can be a major benefit for catching bugs early.

This uses the mypy type checker and builds on top of it as a plugin.

### Test

```
pytest
